    "Aim of the second assignment is the implementation of a segmentation algorithm for bone contours. We will investigate image features extraction and selection methods as bases for image segmentation. Three different approaches are investigated, (1) a classifier based approach using Random Forests, (2) a Deep Learning approach using a UNet and (3) a bone contour Shape Model based approach that uses PCA resulting in a simplified version of Particle Filters.\n",

    "Relevant topics within this exercise:\n",
    "- Feature extraction\n",
    "- Classification and feature selection using Random Forests\n",
    "- Implementation and optimization of a cost function for segmentation\n",

It is lightweight and should be able to run about 100 epochs in less than 10 minutes even when only using a CPU. Unlike a regular ResNet, the residual connections are made on upsampling, where regular U-Nets would have concatenations. The `train_unet_model` function takes in all images and masks and splits them 30-10-10 into training, validation and testing. The model with the smallest validation loss will be returned. Note that every time the model has a new \"best model\", it saves the checkpoint in the `checkpoints` directory. These checkpoints are not deleted automatically and may start to take up considerable storage space when training multiple times.)\n",

An example to create and use a cost function for an optimization process can be found in `optimize_demo.py`. You can simply run it to get an example demonstration of the optimization.\n",
